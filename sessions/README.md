# Session Logging

This directory contains session logs documenting lessons learned, constraints, and AI working patterns for the Localizer project.

## Purpose

Session logs serve as a rolling knowledge base that captures:
- **Lessons Learned**: Issues encountered and their solutions
- **Build Procedures**: Project-specific build steps and considerations
- **Hidden Constraints**: Important limitations not evident in standard documentation
- **Working Patterns**: Effective approaches for AI assistance in this codebase
- **Configuration Pitfalls**: Common mistakes and how to avoid them

## Structure

- Each session is logged with a timestamp
- Logs are cumulative - new sessions build on previous knowledge
- Critical information is indexed for quick reference

## Usage for AI Assistants

Before making changes:
1. Review recent session logs for context
2. Check for documented constraints related to your task
3. Follow established build procedures
4. Add new learnings to the latest session log
